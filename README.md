# Vehicle_Management_System
Project Grade 12 Computer Science / Informatics Practices


This project mainly uses Python as front end and MySQL as backend.

This porject is a connection between mysql and python


There are 3 programs in this project:

Main.py 
Admin.py
Cust.py

The main program is in Main.py

The other 2 python files are imported to the main program.

The Admin.py program can :

insert
update
delete 

values in mysql using python.

The cust.py can only select their choice.
They cannot edit any values in the database.

This program is based on mysql connectivity

For this to work prefectly there should be a module named 

mysql.connector

if not avaiable
can download in command prompt using the command 

pip install mysql-connector


I can asure you that if all the modules are there and it works prefectly 

Then there will we no red mark in your python shell ,

That is their will be no error in the program.


Thank You...
